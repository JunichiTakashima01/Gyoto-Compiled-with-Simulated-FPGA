# Git does not preserve time stamps. This causes problems with files
# generated with the autotools ("automake" and "autoconf"), as
# generated files may seem older than source files and "make" will try
# to regenerate them.
#
# This script fixes time stamps of these generated files.
#
# To run this script automatically after every "git merge" or "git
# pull" invocation, copy it or link it as .git/hooks/post-merge .
