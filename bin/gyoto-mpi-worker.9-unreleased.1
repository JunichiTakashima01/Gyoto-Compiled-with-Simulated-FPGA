.SH DESCRIPTION
Gyoto is a framework for computing geodesics in curved
space-times. The \fBgyoto-mpi-worker\fR helper program is not meant to
be executed directly by the user. It is spawned by the MPI frawework
when using multi-processing. It does not process any command-line
parameter, but passes them to MPI_Init(3). \fBgyoto-mpi-worker\fR is
bound to a specific version of the Gyoto application binary interface
(ABI). To allow for co-installation of several versions of the Gyoto
library, the SO information digits are appended to the executable
name.
