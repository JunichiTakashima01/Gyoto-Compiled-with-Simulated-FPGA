\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Like a Star that would be on all points of its orbit at all time. 

A Star\+Trace is a Star that is considerred to be simultaneously on all the points of its orbit at all time. The purpose is to precompute quickly an integrated image that can later be used as a mask to efficiently compute many images of the underlying Star at varying observing dates.
